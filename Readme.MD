==================================================================

As a source for this dataset has been used the UCI HAR Dataset. This set contains sensor signals from a mobile phone used by 30 test subjects. The have recorded their movement during 6 different activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. 

In this dataset the mean and standard deviation of the features described in the code book is described.An average for each subject and activity is used.


The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.me'

- 'Code Book Coursera project': Shows information about the data file


Notes: 
======
- This dataset is produced as a project in a Coursera Course.
